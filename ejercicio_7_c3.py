# To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data: 
# http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?
# This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like.
# If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.
# To call the API, you need to include a key= parameter and provide the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that
# is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py
# Make sure to check that your code is using the API endpoint is as shown above.
# Please run your program to find the place_id for this location: University of Akron
# Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and your Python code below. Hint: The first seven characters of the place_id are "ChIJbye ..."
